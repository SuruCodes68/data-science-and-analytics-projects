# Data Science & Analytics Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio of my hands-on projects in Machine Learning, NLP, and Data Analysis. Each project includes the full source code and, where applicable, a link to the live, rendered report.

### 1. AeroPath: Bayesian Pathfinding for Drone Navigation

       An end-to-end project that builds a "risk-aware" navigation system for drones. 
       This project moves beyond simple prediction by: 
       1. Using Linear Regression & Cook's Distance for rigorous outlier diagnostics.
       2. Building a Bayesian model (brms) to probabilistically quantify map uncertainty (2,700 simulations/square).
       3. Deploying the model as a weighted graph for an igraph pathfinding algorithm that finds the safest, 
          not shortest, route.

### 2. Automated Misconception Classifier (NLP)

       - Classifies student mathematical misconceptions from free-text explanations using a fine-tuned ELECTRA model. 
       - Overcame extreme class imbalance (up to 14,800:1) via LLM (Qwen) synthetic data generation (113k+ examples),
         achieving 99% accuracy on authentic student responses.

### 3. Netflix Recommender System (Collaborative Filtering)

       - Developed a content-based recommender using TF-IDF vectorization (with n-grams and custom stop words)
         & Cosine Similarity on the Kaggle Netflix dataset (8,800+ titles).
       - Recommends titles via textual analysis (description, genre, title) and includes type filtering, 
         keyword-based explainability,EDA, and t-SNE visualization.

### 4. Global Superstore Analysis (Data Analysis & EDA)

       - A strategic profitability analysis of the Global Superstore dataset.
       - This project moves beyond basic EDA to apply advanced marketing frameworks (RFM Segmentation,
         BCG Matrix quadrant analysis). 
       - It identifies and quantifies key profit drains (e.g., the 'Tables' category losing -$141K),
         pinpoints the 25% discount 'tipping point', and segments customers into actionable groups like
         'Champions' and 'At Risk'.
